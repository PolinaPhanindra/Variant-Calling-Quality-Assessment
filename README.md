# Variant Quality Assessor

## Overview

The **Variant Quality Assessor** is a Python-based tool designed to evaluate the quality of genetic variants from Variant Call Format (VCF) files. It marks variants as "PASS" or "FAIL" based on the following quality metrics:
- **Depth (DP)**: Should be â‰¥ 400.
- **Allele Frequency (AF)**: Should be between 0.001 and 0.2 (inclusive).

The tool is implemented using Python, with features like object-oriented programming, automated tests using `pytest`, Docker support, and CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions.
